Data Visualization Project: Streaming Platforms Growth Over the Years

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize the growth of Netflix using historical data. We will employ various data visualization techniques to narrate the evolution of this streaming platform over time. The analysis will focus on significant visualization patterns that help better understand how Netflix has impacted the entertainment industry and evolved as a business.

Visualizations and Technologies Used
Visualizations: We will utilize various libraries and tools to create interactive and static visualizations, including:
Python: Matplotlib, Pandas plotting, Seaborn
JavaScript: Plotly, D3.js
Databases: Data will be extracted and stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for efficient and scalable data handling.
User Interaction: HTML dropdown menus and selection controls will be implemented to allow users to interact with the visualizations, exploring different aspects of Netflix's growth.
Ethics and Considerations: Measures have been taken to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data used in this project. No personal data will be disclosed or used for visualization creation.
Data Sources: The data used is sourced from public and reliable sources on Netflix's growth over the years.

Storytelling: The Evolution of Streaming
